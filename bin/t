# I've ended up giving each MUD I play its own folder in `~/dev/tintin`, which
# acts as a handle. Inside, initialization is done in a file `init.tt`, which
# defines the session and reads any other files.

# Triggers, macros, etc are to be filed in triggers.tt, so we can `#read` the
# file from a running session without redefining unnecessary things.
